<StyledParagraph>If you're tired of all the different kinds of oat variations out there, you definetly should taste this one. These baked oats are similar to a molten lava cake: creamy decadence in the center and cake like on the outside. Get creative and feel free to change up the flavors using the same base.</StyledParagraph>

## Ingredients

- <ListItem>1/2 cup oats</ListItem>
- <ListItem>1/2 cup plant based milk</ListItem>
- <ListItem>1/2 scoop protein powder</ListItem>
- <ListItem>1/2 banana</ListItem>
- <ListItem>1/2 tsp baking powder</ListItem>
- <ListItem>1 handful of blueberries</ListItem>

- <ListItem>1 tbsp of almond butter</ListItem>

## Steps 
1. Blend the oats, milk, protein powder, banana and baking powder in a blender until all the ingredients are mixed well. Don't blend until smooth since we want to keep the texture of the oats. 
2. Mix in the blueberries and cinnamon. 
3. Transfer into a baking mold of your choice. Scoop in the almond butter into the center of your mixture. 
4. Bake 350 degrees celcius for 15 min until center is still gooey.
