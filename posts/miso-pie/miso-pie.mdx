## Ingredients

## Sesame crust
- <ListItem>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</ListItem> 
- <ListItem>¼ cup (packed) light brown sugar</ListItem> 
- <ListItem>⅓ cup black sesame seeds</ListItem> 
- <ListItem>5 ounces chocolate wafer cookies (about 23), broken into small pieces</ListItem> 
- <ListItem>Pinch of kosher salt</ListItem> 

## Filling
- <ListItem>2 small sweet potatoes (about 1 pound)</ListItem> 
- <ListItem>½ cup (packed) light brown sugar</ListItem> 
- <ListItem>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</ListItem> 
- <ListItem>2 tablespoons white miso</ListItem> 
- <ListItem>2 large egg yolks</ListItem> 
- <ListItem>1 large egg</ListItem> 
- <ListItem>1 cup heavy cream</ListItem> 

## Steps 
1. For the crust, heat butter and brown sugar in a small saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar, until butter is melted.
2. Finely grind sesame seeds in spice mill or with mortar and pestle. Pulse cookies in a food processor until finely ground.
3. Pour butter mixture into food processor; add salt and ground sesame and pulse to combine. 
4. Press cookie mixture firmly onto bottom and up the sides of a 9" pie dish. Freeze until set, 15-20 minutes.
5. Preheat oven to 350°. Bake crust for 15–18 minutes and let cool.
6. Roast sweet potatoes on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet until tender, 50–60 minutes in a 350° oven. Slice open lengthwise and let cool. Scoop out flesh from skins (you should have about 1 cup); pulse in food processor until very smooth. Discard skins.
7. Whisk brown sugar, butter, and miso in a medium bowl until smooth. Add egg yolks and egg and whisk just to incorporate. Whisk in sweet potato purée, then cream.
8. Reduce oven temperature to 300°. Pour filling into crust. Bake pie, rotating halfway through, until filling is set (it will still wobble slightly in the very center), 50–60 minutes.
9. Serve pie topped with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream and ENJOY!
