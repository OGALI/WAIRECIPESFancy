Gatsby Starter - Recipes
========================

This is a [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) starter project for a recipes website. It's configured to pull recipe data from [Flotiq](https://flotiq.com) and can be easily deployed to your cloud hosting - Heroku, Netlify, Gatsby Cloud, etc.

Live Demo: https://flotiq-starter-recipes.herokuapp.com

## Quick start

1. **Start the project from template using [Flotiq CLI]((https://github.com/flotiq/flotiq-cli))**

    ```bash
   npm install -g flotiq-cli
   flotiq start [flotiqApiKey] [projectName] https://github.com/flotiq/gatsby-starter-recipes.git
    ```
   * `flotiqApKey` - Read and write API key to your Flotiq account      
   * `projectName` - project name or project path (if you wish to start or import data from the current directory - use `.`)

1. **You can also start the project from template using Gatsby CLI**
    
    ```bash
    gatsby new gatsby-starter-recipes https://github.com/flotiq/gatsby-starter-recipes.git
    ```
1. **Setup "Recipe" Content Type in Flotiq**

   Create your [Flotiq.com](https://flotiq.com) account. Next, create the `Recipe` Content Type:

   ![Recipe content type in flotiq](docs/create-definition-recipe.png)
    
   _Note: You can also create `Recipe` using [Flotiq REST API](https://flotiq.com/docs/API/)._ 

1. **Configure application**

    The next step is to configure our application to know from where it has to fetch the data.
       
    You need to create a file called `.env` inside the root of the directory, with the following structure:

    ```
    GATSBY_FLOTIQ_API_KEY=YOUR FLOTIQ API KEY
    ```

1.  **Start developing**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd gatsby-starter-recipes
    npm install
    gatsby develop
    ```
    
    This step is optional and is not necessary if you used flotiq-cli to start the project.
    
    If you wish to import example recipes to your account, before running `gatsby develop`, install [flotiq-cli](https://github.com/flotiq/flotiq-cli), and run in project directory:
    
    ```sh
    flotiq import [flotiqApiKey] .
    ```
    
    It will add 4 images and 2 recipes to your Flotiq account.
    
    _Note: ou need to put your Read and write API key as the `flotiqApiKey` for import to work. You don't need the `Recipe` content type in your account. If you already have recipes with ids `recipe-1` and `recipe-2` they will be overwritten._
   
1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**
    
    Your site is now running at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)!
    
    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _[http://localhost:8000/___graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql)`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
    
    Open a project directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/templates/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

1. **Manage your recipes using Flotiq editor**
      
    You can now easily manage your recipes using [Flotiq editor](https://editor.flotiq.com)
